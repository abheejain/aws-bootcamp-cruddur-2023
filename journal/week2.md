## Run queries to explore traces within Honeycomb.io

Running various querries was done using the reference from https://docs.honeycomb.io/getting-data-in/opentelemetry/python/ to `acquiring the Tracer` and for `Query to trace` 

Various Queries run and results received for `app.data` and `app_results_length`

- Added Sampling Rules using `AWS CLI`
    We used CLI, compared to the AWS Console because, the interface keep changing, but we know the values to set using CLI is easy.

Tried to workput with the `UserActivities` service, but received `500` error`. I would skip now and keep it for my extended homework
