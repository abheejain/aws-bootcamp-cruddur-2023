- User Handle is still not updated, because we have not mentioned or selected to set the `attributes` while creating the User Pool, so I changed it manually in the `Edit User` on the Cognito Pool Console

NOTE: The verification is done for the `Signin Page`, and it is not good practice to add users manually, we will delete the Users from Cognito Pool and go ahead to proceed setting up for `Signup Page`
